Initial State of the Gym that Needed Renovation

Our recent project involved the comprehensive renovation of a gym located within an apartment building in Deira, Dubai. The task at hand was to rejuvenate the existing space, addressing various issues that had arisen over time. The gym equipment had experienced wear and tear, requiring both repairs and replacements. Furthermore, the ceiling tiles and framing were found to be in a state of disrepair and demanded immediate attention. To bring a fresh aesthetic to the gym, a complete overhaul was initiated, encompassing new paint, flooring, and updated electrical switches.

Upon careful deliberation and initial modeling sessions, decisions were made regarding wall paint colors and the selection of appropriate switches. The existing walls presented a challenge due to accumulated dirt and multiple colors. To achieve a pristine base, the decision was made to initially coat them with a durable white oil-based paint, ensuring a lasting finish.

Following the preparation phase, the walls were painted according to the finalized design. Simultaneously, the installation of new ceiling tiles and other planned activities commenced. Due to the presence of two distinct colors in the design scheme, the painting process spanned two consecutive days.

Subsequently, the gym equipment was carefully dismantled for repairs, and the flooring replacement initiative was set into motion. Concurrently, the installation of mirrors, strategically positioned to enhance the overall gym experience, was undertaken.
