In Dubai, landlords are entrusted with the duty of conducting maintenance and repair tasks for leased apartments. This obligation is outlined in Article 16 of the Dubai Rent Law, which asserts that unless otherwise stipulated by the involved parties, landlords are accountable for upholding the property's condition and rectifying any malfunctions or defects that hinder the tenant's complete and intended utilization of the property.

Furthermore, landlords may bear the responsibility of addressing breakdowns, damages, or flaws occurring in rented apartments, provided these issues arise due to circumstances beyond the tenant's control. Article 17 of the Dubai Rent Law stipulates this, emphasizing that landlords are prohibited from making alterations to the property or its facilities that would obstruct their designated purpose. In instances where such changes are made, whether by the landlord or an authorized individual, the landlord remains answerable. Likewise, any impairment, dysfunction, flaw, or harm sustained by the property due to uncontrollable factors falls within the landlord's sphere of responsibility.

Considering the aforementioned points, it is incumbent upon your landlord to execute the necessary maintenance and repair tasks for the rented apartment, unless the lease contract explicitly designates certain maintenance and repair tasks for you as the tenant, at your own expense.

Conversely, as a tenant, you are entrusted with preserving the rented apartment in a satisfactory state and refraining from making alterations or undertaking restoration and upkeep endeavors without securing the landlord's consent. Article 19 of the Dubai Rent Law underscores this tenant responsibility.
