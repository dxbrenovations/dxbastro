We were called upon to investigate and address a concerning leakage issue at a villa situated in Dubai Sports City. The repercussions of this problem were visibly evident on the false ceiling of the ground floor, prompting our team to scrutinize the upper floor, particularly the master bedroom, where the issue seemed to originate.

Upon our initial inspection, we decided to delve into the matter by carefully dismantling the WC. The suspicion arose due to its noticeable instability. However, even after re-fixing it, the persistence of the problem urged us to broaden our investigation. We meticulously examined the main lines connected to all bathtub and standing shower mixers, extending our scrutiny beneath the bathtub. The discovery of damp sand, though noteworthy, did not seem to be the primary source of the water.

  

Our investigative journey took a more intrusive turn as we decided to open up the ceiling. To our surprise, the water flow persisted, even in the absence of bathroom use for two consecutive days. This was a clear indicator that the root cause lay within the main water line rather than the drainage system. Redirecting our attention to this crucial aspect, we identified a damp angle valve beside the WC. Closer examination revealed a crack on the rusty angle valve, pinpointing the source of the leakage.
