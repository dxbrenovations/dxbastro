In this project, our assignment involved the repair of walls damaged by water leakage in an office building in Deira - Dubai. Although the root cause of the water leakage had been addressed, residual damage remained that required restoration. The majority of the damage was minimal and confined to the surface of the concrete and wall paint. Identifying all damaged locations and documenting their current condition was a crucial initial step.

It complies with ASTM C 475 and is suitable for gypsum boards, cement boards, concrete walls, plastered concrete, and plastered block walls.

Distinguished by its elastic properties, Handycoat Exterior is a permanent solution that does not flake off and maintains strong adhesion. After drying, it exhibits weather resistance and bonds exceptionally well to cementitious materials, gypsum, gypsum boards, Sprayplaster, and wood. Its versatile applications include thin-coat filling for patching hairline cracks, repairing damaged plasterwork and paintwork, filling holes and defects in woodwork, and addressing dents in galvanized and anti-rust-primed metal.
