When it comes to achieving a flawless, long-lasting paint finish, proper wall preparation is key. Skipping any steps in the preparation process can result in uneven surfaces, peeling paint, or colors that fade prematurely. Whether you're painting an apartment or a villa, taking the time to prepare the walls properly ensures that your final result is both aesthetically pleasing and durable. Here’s a breakdown of the essential steps involved in preparing your walls for painting, including priming, applying stucco, sanding, and finally, applying two coats of high-quality paint such as  **Fenomastic Hygiene Emulsion Matt**  by  **Jotun**.

#### 1.  **Cleaning the Surface**

The first step in preparing a wall for painting is ensuring that the surface is clean and free of any dirt, dust, grease, or mildew. This is especially important if the walls have not been painted for a long time or are exposed to moisture, such as in kitchens and bathrooms. Use a mild detergent and a sponge to scrub off any grime, and let the surface dry completely.

#### 2.  **Inspecting and Repairing Cracks and Holes**

Before applying primer, you need to carefully inspect the walls for any damage, such as cracks, holes, or dents. Even small imperfections can affect the final look of your paint. Use a high-quality filler or stucco to patch up these damaged areas. For deeper cracks, apply multiple layers of stucco, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next.

#### 3.  **Applying Stucco for a Smooth Surface**

Stucco or putty is crucial to smoothing out uneven surfaces and ensuring the wall is ready for paint. After repairing any cracks or holes, you may need to apply stucco across the entire surface for consistency. Stucco fills in rough patches, seals off minor imperfections, and creates a level surface for painting. Allow the stucco to dry thoroughly before moving to the next step, as moisture can negatively impact the paint finish.

#### 4.  **Sanding the Walls**

Once the stucco has dried, the next step is sanding. This is essential for creating a smooth surface, which helps the paint adhere properly. Sand the entire wall using medium-grit sandpaper, paying extra attention to areas that have been patched or treated with stucco. After sanding, make sure to wipe the wall with a damp cloth to remove any dust or debris. A clean, dust-free surface is crucial for ensuring even paint application.

#### 5.  **Applying Primer**

Primer acts as a base coat for your paint and is especially important if you're painting over new stucco, a dark color, or a surface that has been exposed to moisture. Applying a primer ensures that the paint sticks better to the wall and lasts longer. It also helps the true color of your paint shine through. Use a high-quality primer, and ensure the surface is fully covered and evenly coated. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, typically about 24 hours.

#### 6.  **Choosing the Right Paint: Fenomastic Hygiene Emulsion Matt**

When it comes to selecting paint, quality is key. For interior spaces,  **Fenomastic Hygiene Emulsion Matt**  by  **Jotun**  is an excellent choice. It offers a smooth, durable matte finish while being easy to clean. This high-quality paint is designed to inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold, making it ideal for homes in humid climates like Dubai. Fenomastic also provides excellent coverage, which means fewer coats are required compared to other brands.

#### 7.  **Applying the First Coat of Paint**

After the primer has dried, it’s time to apply the first coat of paint. Using a roller for large areas and a brush for edges and corners, apply the paint in even strokes, working from top to bottom. For a more uniform finish, use a "W" or "M" motion when rolling. Make sure to apply an even layer and avoid overloading the roller or brush, as this can cause streaks or drips. Allow the first coat to dry completely (usually around 4-6 hours) before applying the second coat.

#### 8.  **Applying the Second Coat**

The second coat of paint will help cover any inconsistencies and deepen the color. Just like the first coat, apply the second layer evenly using the same technique. Two coats of paint will ensure that the finish is even, vibrant, and durable.  **Fenomastic Hygiene Emulsion Matt**  provides a high-quality finish that enhances the aesthetics of the room and ensures long-lasting results.

### Conclusion

Proper wall preparation before painting is essential for achieving a beautiful and long-lasting finish. From cleaning and repairing the surface to applying primer and high-quality paint, each step plays a vital role in the final outcome. By using  **Fenomastic Hygiene Emulsion Matt**  by  **Jotun**, you can ensure your walls not only look great but are also protected against wear and tear, mold, and moisture.
