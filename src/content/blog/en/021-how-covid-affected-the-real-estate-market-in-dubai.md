The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly left its mark on global economies, and the Dubai real estate market was not exempt from its impact. The initial months saw a period of uncertainty and adjustments, with fluctuations in demand and property values. However, it's noteworthy that the impact was not uniform across all areas of Dubai. While some segments experienced a temporary slowdown, other strategic locations showcased resilience and, in certain cases, even witnessed growth. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, certain areas of Dubai's real estate market demonstrated remarkable stability, and in some instances, property prices continued to rise. This resilience suggests the dynamic and adaptive nature of Dubai's real estate sector, underscoring its ability to weather challenging circumstances and maintain a trajectory of growth in select regions.

The following chart indicates the average monthly price of a one bedroom apartment in Dubai which it can be seen that the covid had an impact on the prices. However, some areas were still experiencing increase despite the covid.

In this report we consider the covid era starting from 8 March 2020 when the Ministry of Education announced a four-week closure of all public and private schools and higher education institutions across the UAE ([Khaleej Times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus/100-days-of-covid-19-the-proactive-steps-uae-has-taken-so-far)).

The covid restrictions were finally removed on 7th November 2022 and a day later all entry requirements and precautionary measures related to COVID-19 for passengers travelling to, from or through Dubai have been lifted ([Khaleed Times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus/covid-19-uae-announces-cancellation-of-all-restrictions-and-precautionary-measures)).

Using the two above dates we can compare the average price of 1 bedroom apartments in Dubai at different areas and measure the percent change between the two eras.

According to the data from Dubai Land Department, areas such as Palm Jumeirah, Mirdif, Business Bay, Marsa Dubai, and Al Barsha South experienced incense in the average of one bedroom prices.

The graph below indicates the distribution of prices before and during Covid era for one bedroom apartments in Palm Jumeirah in Dubai.

As we can see, the at the prices are shifted during covid and the the average prices shifted from about AED 1,740,000 to AED 2,400,000. Using the t-test we can confirm that at 95% confidence interval the two averages are not the same.

Of course the above is a general comparison and factors such as the building quality or the view of each apartment can impact the price. So, to have an accurate conclusion, more details shall be included in the study.
