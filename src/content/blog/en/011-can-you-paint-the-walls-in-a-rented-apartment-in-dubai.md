Renting an apartment in Dubai comes with a unique set of rules and considerations, especially when it comes to making changes to the property. One of the most common questions tenants have is whether or not they can paint the walls of their rented apartment. The good news is that in many cases, landlords do allow tenants to paint the walls to add their personal touch, but there are a few conditions that tenants need to be aware of.

Many landlords in Dubai are open to the idea of tenants customizing their space through wall painting, as long as the tenant agrees to return the apartment to its original state before vacating the property. This means that while you can paint the walls in your preferred colors, you’ll need to repaint them in the original color before moving out. The reason for this is that landlords want to ensure the property is ready for the next tenant without any extra costs or delays.

If a tenant fails to revert the walls to their original condition, the landlord typically has the right to deduct the cost of repainting from the tenant's security deposit. This is why it’s essential for tenants to carefully read their lease agreement and communicate with their landlord before making any changes. Getting written permission to paint the walls can help avoid any misunderstandings down the line.
