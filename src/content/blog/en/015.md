Renovation of a three bedroom Villa in Dubai

Our team was tasked with the comprehensive renovation and repair of a villa located in Springs, Dubai. The villa had recently been vacated by tenants and was left with various damages requiring extensive maintenance and repairs. Additionally, the client requested specific renovations focused on the kitchen and bathrooms to enhance the living space.

Kitchen Renovation: The kitchen required a complete overhaul. We removed the existing cabinets and wall tiles and carefully measured the walls and the clear height from the floor to the ceiling. It was noted that the clear height was inconsistent across different locations, necessitating some gaps between the cabinets to ensure easy access to the water tank above the ceiling for future maintenance. Following client approval of the design and selection of cabinet colors and stone countertops, we created a 3D model to ensure client satisfaction. The cabinets, manufactured in our carpentry workshop, were then delivered and installed in the villa, with the installation process taking about a week to minimize disruption and dust.

Bathroom Upgrades: The bathroom cabinets required refreshing, and we replaced the vanity countertops in all three bathrooms. We used Terraco Handycoat Exterior for patching and repairing minor cracks. All hinges and door handles were replaced. Additionally, we cleaned the bathroom tiles, though some dark markings could not be completely removed and indicated the need for tile replacement.

Wall and Floor Repairs: Significant effort was directed towards repairing and painting the villa's walls. The walls were manually sanded before realizing the efficiency of using a sanding machine. Protective measures were taken to safeguard the floor and electrical sockets during this process. We applied gypsum joint compound to achieve a smooth finish and used an oil-based white paint for its durability. The final coat was applied in two stages due to the dual-color scheme.

  

Flooring: The tile grout throughout the villa needed replacement, a labor-intensive task that required precision to avoid damaging the tiles while ensuring a deep enough cut for the new grout. We used electrical tools and vacuums to manage the dust, ensuring a clean and long-lasting finish.

Doors: Most doors in the villa had water damage and old, malfunctioning hinges. These were repaired, repainted, and replaced as necessary. Bedroom, wardrobe, and storage doors were sent to a workshop for repair and painting, while door frames were attended to on-site. New hinges were installed upon reinstallation of the doors.

Exterior and Additional Repairs: The exterior walls of the villa received a fresh coat of paint, matched precisely with a sample taken to the paint shop. We also removed a planter in the garden and leveled the parking area, which required removing and replacing interlocks. The water tank was removed, and connections were modified accordingly. We discovered and replaced a faulty pressure controller and main valve, coordinating with DEWA for a water shutoff.

Miscellaneous Tasks: Other tasks included clearing a blockage in the kitchen drain, which took two days due to accumulated garbage. We replaced the water heater in the kitchen, correcting the dangerous and incorrect installation of a smaller unit. We also serviced the AC system, replacing two compressors and fan motors. All fly screens were replaced, including eight rolling screens, and several aluminum door handles were fixed. Sliding door mechanisms were adjusted for smoother operation, and ceiling tiles in the bathrooms were replaced. Various malfunctioning lights were also attended to.
