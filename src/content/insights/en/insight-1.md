Renovating a villa in Dubai is one of the best ways to modernize your home, enhance comfort, and increase property value. Whether you’ve owned your villa for years or recently purchased one, renovation allows you to customize every corner according to your lifestyle. The cost of renovating a 3-bedroom villa in Dubai depends on several factors—such as material quality, scope of work, and level of finishing—but understanding the major components can help you plan your budget wisely.

## Floor Tiling: A Fresh Foundation

One of the most common renovation upgrades is changing the floor tiles. You can either install new tiles directly over the existing ones or remove the old tiles completely before installing the new ones.

Laying over existing tiles is faster and more affordable, but it’s only suitable if the old tiles are in good condition and properly leveled.

Removing and replacing tiles, on the other hand, takes more time and involves additional labor for demolition and disposal of the debris—but it ensures a cleaner, long-lasting finish.

For a good-quality porcelain tile, the material typically costs around AED 60–100 per square meter, while installation and removal labor can range between AED 40–80 per square meter, depending on the complexity and design pattern.

## Bathroom Renovation: From Old to Modern

Modern bathroom designs in Dubai are shifting away from traditional acrylic bathtubs toward standing showers with glass enclosures. A full bathroom renovation involves multiple steps:

Removing all existing floor and wall tiles

Replastering and waterproofing the walls and floor

Modifying floor drains or plumbing lines if required

Installing new tiles, mixers, shower glass, and vanity units

This type of renovation requires skilled work and attention to detail to prevent future water leakage or drainage issues. Depending on the tile selection and fittings, the cost can vary between AED 12,000 and AED 25,000 per bathroom for a complete makeover.

## Kitchen Renovation: The Heart of the Home

The kitchen is often the centerpiece of a villa renovation. A modern kitchen renovation typically includes:

New floor and wall tiles

Replacement of old cabinets with sleek, modern ones

Upgrading the countertop to quartz or granite

Reorganizing the layout for better functionality and space efficiency

If you’re aiming for a stylish and practical design, expect to spend around AED 25,000 to AED 45,000, depending on the size of the kitchen and materials used.

## Doors and Wardrobes: Subtle but Impactful

Updating your bedroom doors and wardrobes can dramatically improve the overall look of your villa. You can either repaint or polish the existing ones for a fresh finish, or replace them completely with modern designs in MDF or solid wood.

Painting and refinishing typically cost AED 400–800 per door.

Complete replacement can range from AED 1,500–3,000 per door, depending on the design and material.

## Layout Modifications: Creating Open, Modern Spaces

Another popular trend in villa renovation is modifying the layout to create open, flowing spaces. Homeowners often opt to convert a closed kitchen into an open one, allowing natural light to fill the space and creating a more social environment. Others may add or remove internal partitions to expand rooms, create a home office, or add a walk-in closet. Such structural changes involve extra work in civil modification, plastering, and painting but can completely transform the way a villa feels.

## Final Thoughts

Renovating a 3-bedroom villa in Dubai can cost anywhere from AED 150,000 to AED 300,000, depending on the level of customization, material quality, and finishes you choose.
